# Changelog

All notable changes to the Arsel Android SDK.

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). A breaking change costs every
integrator an app-store release, so the public API and the wire contract are frozen within a major
version: additive changes ship as minor releases, and anything breaking waits for `2.0.0`.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-19

### In-app messaging

Messages authored in Arsel now render inside the host app, with no notification permission and no
prompt of any kind.

The division of labour is the design: the server resolves audience, consent, campaign window,
grants and lifetime caps into a per-device catalogue, and the SDK evaluates only the trigger and
its session-scoped caps locally — so drawing a message costs no network round-trip and works with
no connection at all.

- Four trigger types resolve from events the SDK already emits: app open (from
  `arsel.session_start`, not the raw foreground callback, which is rate-limited and would fire for
  a two-second tab-out), screen views, and custom events.
- `Arsel.screen(name, properties)` — records a screen view. One event, two consumers: it reaches
  segments and automations exactly as `track()` does, and it is the trigger source for
  screen-scoped messages. Deliberately not a `track()` convention name, because the backend treats
  a screen view and a custom event of the same name as different trigger types.
- `Arsel.setInAppMessagingEnabled(enabled)` — holds messages back for the moments a host knows are
  wrong, such as a checkout step. Not persisted: it describes the current screen, not the device.
- Five layouts — modal, top and bottom banners, fullscreen, image-only — drawn in code rather than
  from XML, so the library ships no layout resources to collide with a host app's own.
- Impressions, clicks and dismissals are reported through the existing durable queue, so they
  survive an offline spell and process death. An impression is recorded only once the view is
  actually attached: a message abandoned during its delay window leaves no trace at all.
- A reserved `arsel_iam_sync` push refreshes the catalogue and renders nothing. It is handled
  before the message parse, the claim and the delivered engagement, so a sync ping can never book
  delivery against a campaign that was never sent.

### Changed

- `ApiClient` gains a conditional `get()`, and `classify()` now treats `304 Not Modified` as a
  success. Without that branch a conditional request falls through to a permanent failure and the
  cache is discarded on every successful revalidation — the opposite of what the request asks for.
- `ForegroundWatcher` tracks the resumed Activity behind a `WeakReference`, so a message is drawn
  into the screen actually in front of the user rather than one sitting behind a dialog.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-17

First public release. Two subsystems in one artifact, deliberately independent of each other.

### Events and identity — `sa.arsel:core`

Works on a handset that has never granted notification permission, has no FCM token, and does not
have Firebase on the classpath at all.

- `Arsel.track(name, properties)` — durable custom events, queued to disk and drained by
  WorkManager, so they survive process death, offline periods and app kills.
- `Arsel.identify(externalId, email, phoneNumber)` — everything tracked beforehand under the
  anonymous identity merges onto the contact it resolves to. `email` and `phoneNumber` are
  shape-checked client-side; a changed `externalId` drops the previous identity's stored email and
  phone rather than carrying them onto a different person.
- An anonymous identity minted at first run and persisted, exposed by `Arsel.getAnonymousId()`.
  Distinct from the installation id, which names the handset — `reset()` rotates the anonymous id so
  a shared device never hands the next user the previous one's history.
- Automatic `arsel.session_start` / `arsel.session_end`, derived from foreground/background
  transitions with no timers. A session ends after 30 minutes away, and the end event is emitted on
  the next foreground backdated to when the app actually left. A user who never returns produces no
  `session_end` — a fabricated end time is worse than a missing one.
- The `arsel.` event-name prefix and the `arsel_*` push data keys are reserved and refused to hosts,
  so a customer's own names can never collide with the SDK's.

### Push notifications — `sa.arsel:push-fcm`

Firebase glue only. `core` never touches a Firebase type, which is what lets the events API run with
no Firebase present.

- Drop-in delivery: `ArselPushService` claims Arsel messages, renders the notification on a
  configured channel, and reports engagement. Hosts running their own `FirebaseMessagingService`
  call `Arsel.isArselData(data)` / `Arsel.handlePushData(...)` instead.
- Engagement reporting distinguishes `DELIVERED`, `DISPLAYED`, `SUPPRESSED` (with a reason),
  `OPENED`, `CLICKED` (action buttons only) and `DISMISSED`.
- Notification actions, deep links, images and per-campaign channel overrides.
- `Arsel.optOut()` — a durable, user-initiated opt-out, distinct from `reset()`, which is logout and
  leaves the device subscribed.
- Registration carries the anonymous id, so a push subscription lands on the same contact the events
  attach to. Backends that already know the signed-in user can bind authoritatively instead, via
  `POST /v1/push/devices` with the installation id.

### Reliability

- **Persist before send; confirm on 2xx.** Requests are queued to disk, removed by id, and the drain
  stops at the first retryable failure to preserve oldest-first ordering.
- Event sends carry an `Idempotency-Key` — the queued request's persisted id, identical across
  retries — closing the duplicate window between a server 2xx and a dequeue that never happened.
- The device secret is issued exactly once on first registration and presented as
  `X-Arsel-Device-Auth` on every subsequent mutation.
- Inbound messages are claimed in two phases, so a render failure releases the claim and FCM's
  redelivery gets another chance rather than suppressing the notification permanently.
- `Retry-After` is honoured on `429`.

### Operability

- `Arsel.diagnostics()` — a snapshot safe to paste into a support ticket: no FCM token, no device
  secret. Registration and subscription state, last response code and path, queue depths, permission
  state, channel importance, and whether Firebase is present.
- No callbacks into the host by design — a bug in a host callback invoked mid-teardown takes down a
  customer's app. Observation is by polling `diagnostics()`.
- Auto Backup and device-transfer exclusion rules for the SDK's preferences, so a restored backup
  never resurrects another device's installation identity.
