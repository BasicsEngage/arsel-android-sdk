/**
 * Emits `arsel.session_start` / `arsel.session_end` from foreground and background transitions.
 *
 * **No timers.** A session ends when the app has been in the background longer than
 * [SESSION_GAP_MS], but that fact is only *discovered* on the next foreground — so the end event is
 * emitted then, backdated to the moment the app actually went away. The alternative, a scheduled
 * timer, would have to survive process death and doze to be correct, and would fire in a process
 * that may no longer exist.
 *
 * The consequence, and it is the standard one for mobile analytics: a user who never returns never
 * produces a `session_end`. A session that is open but unclosed is better than a fabricated end
 * time, and the start event already carries everything a funnel needs.
 *
 * State lives in [ArselStore] rather than memory because backgrounding is exactly when the process
 * gets killed — an in-memory `backgroundedAt` would be lost in the case it exists to handle.
